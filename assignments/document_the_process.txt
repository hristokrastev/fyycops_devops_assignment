   Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
   metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

   The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
   and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
   improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

   To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
   To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

-expose the app to internet
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tech_talks/how-to-use-kubernetes-services-to-expose-your-app

add service.yaml and add Loadbalancer:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fyyc
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: fyyc
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer


kubectl get services


- config the application

update the application.yml file as follows


app:
  banner:
    label: "DIGITALOCEAN"
    color: "blue"

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "health"


- Add liveness and readiness probes

started to add parts from here:

https://medium.com/@salarai.de/how-to-enable-liveness-and-readiness-probes-in-a-spring-boot-application-a40cf3423db3

stopped when it get too much java :)
